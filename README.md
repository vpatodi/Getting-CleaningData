# Tidy Data  setfrom the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

A few steps were taken to transform the initial data set. The test and train sets have were merged and the subject identifiers and activity labels were pulled in to create a single data set. The activity identifiers were translated from identifiers into human-readable names. Only the mean and standard deviation variables were kept. Those variables were further summarized by taking their mean for each subject/activity pair. The data is in "wide" format as described by [Wickham](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf); there is a single row for each subject/activity pair, and a single column for each measurement.
